# gamebox-clicker
  GameBox Clicker is a small DIY game console built around a 2×3 fidget clicker.
  This project is a follow-up to my previous 2×2 Fidget Clicker project.
  While the first project focused on creating a tactile button device,
  GameBox Clicker takes that idea one step further—turning the clicker into a real game controller.

The concept is very simple:
  Use a 2×3 fidget clicker as physical keys
  Connect it to a small OLED display

Play three classic mini games on a tiny, handmade console
Currently, the console includes:
  - Pong
  - Snake
  - Stair

Why I Made This
  This project is not about powerful hardware or complex graphics.
  Instead, it explores:
  How far we can go with very limited input
  How simple buttons can still create fun gameplay
  How small DIY projects can grow into new ideas
  The games are intentionally simple.
  The hardware is intentionally minimal.
My hope is that:
Someone will see this project
and build something even better, different, or unexpected from it.
